> In the previous post, [Infinite Series of Constants]({% post_url 2021-09-06-infinite-series-of-constants %}), we mentioned a type of series called **power series** a lot. In the content of this post, we will be diving deeper into details of that series.

## Power Series
A **power series** is a series of the form
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^n=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\ldots+a_nx^n+\ldots,
\end{equation}
where the coefficient $a_n$ are constants and $x$ is a variable.
