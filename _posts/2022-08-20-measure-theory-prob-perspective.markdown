## Probabilities Spaces
{: #prob-spaces}
A **probability space** is a triple $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$ where 
- $\Omega$ is a set of "outcomes";
- $\mathcal{F}$ is a set of "events";
- $P:\mathcal{F}\to[0,1]$ is a function that assigns probabilities to events.

##### $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$-field
We assume that $\mathcal{F}$ is a **$\boldsymbol{\sigma}$-field** (or **$\boldsymbol{\sigma}$-algebra**), i.e., a (nonempty) collection of subsets of $\Omega$ that satisfy  
(i) If $A\in\mathcal{F}$ then $A^c\in\mathcal{F}$[^1].  
(ii) If $A_i\in\mathcal{F}$ is a countable sequence of sets then $\cup_i A_i\in\mathcal{F}$.  
Since $\cap_i A_i=\left(\cup_i A_i\right)^c$, it follows that a $\sigma$-field is closed[^2] under countable intersection.

##### Measurable space, measure, probability measure
{: #measurable-space-measure-prob-measure}
Without $P$, $(\Omega,\mathcal{F})$ is called a **measurable space**, i.e., a space on which we can put on a measure. A **measure** is a nonnegative countably additive set function; that is, a function $\mu:\mathcal{F}\to\mathbb{R}$ with  
(i) $\mu(A)\geq\mu(\emptyset)=0$ for all $A\in\mathcal{F}$.
(ii) If $A_i\in\mathcal{F}$ is a countable sequence of disjoint sets, then
\begin{equation}
\mu\left(\bigcup_i A_i\right)=\sum_i\mu(A_i)
\end{equation}

If $\mu(\Omega)=1$, then $\mu$ is called a **probability measure**.

**Theorem 1**  
*Let $\mu$ be a measure on $(\Omega,\mathcal{F})$. Then $\mu$ has these following properties:  
(i) <b>monotonicity</b>. If $A\subset B$ then $\mu(A)\leq\mu(B)$.  
(ii) <b>subadditivity</b>. If $A\subset\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_i$ then $\mu(A)\leq\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(A_i)$.  
(iii) <b>continuity from below</b>. If $A_i\uparrow A$ (i.e., $A_1\subset A_2\subset\dots$ and $\bigcup_i A_i=A$) then $\mu(A_i)\uparrow\mu(A)$.  
(iv) <b>continuity from above</b>. If $A_i\downarrow A$ (i.e., $A_1\supset A_2\supset\dots$ and $\bigcap_i A_i=A$) with $\mu(A_i)<\infty$ then $\mu(A_i)\downarrow\mu(A)$.*

*Proof*      
(i) Using $+$ to denote disjoint union and $-$ to represent **difference** of the two sets[^3], since $B=A+(B-A)$ so
\begin{equation}
\mu(B)=\mu(A)+\mu(B-A)\geq\mu(A)
\end{equation}
(ii) Let $A_i'\doteq A\cup A_i$; let $B_i\doteq A_i'-\bigcup_{j=1}^{i=1}(A_j')^c$ and $B_1\doteq A_1'$. Thus, we have that $B_i$'s are disjoint and $A=\bigcup_i B_i$.  
Using (i) in the definition of measure, $B_i\subset A_i$, and (i) of this theorem, we have
\begin{equation}
\mu(A)\doteq\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(B_i)\leq\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(A_i)
\end{equation}
(iii) Let $B_i\doteq A_i-A_{i-1}$. Therefore, $B_i$'s are disjoint and $\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}B_i=A$ and $\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}B_i=A_n$, thus,
\begin{equation}
\mu(A)=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(B_i)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mu(B_i)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\mu(A_n)
\end{equation}
(iv) Since $A_i\downarrow A$, we have that $A_1-A_i\uparrow A_1-A$.  
Using (iii) and $A_1\supset A$, we obtain that $\mu(A_1-A_i)\uparrow\mu(A_1-A)$. Moreover since $A_1\supset A_i\supset A$, from (i), we also have that
\begin{align}
\mu(A_1)-\mu(A_i)&\uparrow\mu(A_1)-\mu(A) \\\\ \Rightarrow\mu(A_i)&\downarrow\mu(A)
\end{align}

**Example 1**  
(i) If $\mathcal{F}\_i,i\in I$ ($I\neq\emptyset$ is an arbitrary index set) are $\sigma$-fields then $\bigcap_{i\in I}\mathcal{F}\_i$ also is.  
(ii) If we are given a set $\Omega$ and a collection $\mathcal{A}$ of subsets of $\Omega$, then there is a smallest $\sigma$-field containing $\mathcal{A}$, called the **$\boldsymbol{\sigma}$-field generated by $\mathbf{\mathcal{A}}$** and denoted as $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$.

**Solution**  
(i) In order to proof that $\bigcap_{i\in I}\mathcal{F}\_i$ is a $\sigma$-field, we proves that it satisfies two properties of a $\sigma$-field.
- On the one hand, consider an arbitrary set $A\in\bigcap_{i\in I}\mathcal{A}$, so $A\in\mathcal{F}\_i,\,\forall i\in I$. Since $\mathcal{F}\_i$ is a $\sigma$-field for all $i\in I$, we have that $A^c\in\mathcal{F}\_i,\,\forall i\in I$. Therefore, $A^c\in\bigcap_{i\in I}\mathcal{F}\_i$.  
- On the other hand, consider a countable of sets $A_j\in\bigcap_{i\in I}\mathcal{F}\_i$, then $A_j\in\mathcal{F}\_i,\,\forall i\in I$ and for all $A_j$ in the sequence. Since $\mathcal{F}\_i,i\in I$ are $\sigma$-fields, it implies that $\bigcup_j A_j\in\mathcal{F}\_i,\,\forall i\in I$, which leads to the result that $\bigcup_j A_j\in\bigcap_{i\in I}\mathcal{F}\_i$.

With these two satisfied properties, we can conclude that $\bigcap_{i\in I}\mathcal{A}\_i$ is also a $\sigma$-field.

(ii) Let $\mathcal{F}\_i$ be a sequence of $\sigma$-field containing $A$. From (i), we have that $\bigcap_i\mathcal{F}\_i$ is also a $\sigma$-field, and $A\in\bigcap_i\mathcal{F}\_i$. Hence, there exists a smallest $\sigma$-field containing $A$.

**Example 2**. **Measure on the real line**  
Measures on $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{R})$[^4], are defined by giving probability a **Stieltjes measure function**, denoted as $F$, with the following properties:  
(i) $F$ is non-decreasing.  
(ii) $F$ is right continuous, i.e., $\lim_{y\downarrow x}F(y)=F(x)$.

**Theorem 2**  
*Associated with each Stieltjes measure function $F$, there is a measure $\mu$ on $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{R})$ with
\begin{equation}
\mu((a,b])=F(b)-F(a)\tag{1}\label{1}
\end{equation}*

##### Lebesgue measure
{: #lebesgue-measure}
When $F(x)=x$, the resulting measure is called **Lebesgue measure**.

##### Semialgebra
{: #semialgebra}
A collection $\mathcal{S}$ of sets is said to be **semialgebra** if  
(i) it is **closed under intersection**, i.e., $S,T\in\mathcal{S}$ implies that $S\cap T\in\mathcal{S}$.  
(ii) If $S\in\mathcal{S}$, then $S^c$ is a finite disjoint union of sets in $\mathcal{S}$.

**Example 3**  
Let $\mathcal{S}\_d$ is the set of the empty set plus all sets of the form
\begin{equation}
(a_1,b_1]\times\dots\times(a_d,b_d]\subset\mathbb{R}^d,\hspace{2cm}-\infty\leq a_i\lt b_i\leq\infty
\end{equation}
We have that $\mathcal{S}\_d$ is a semialgebra.

##### Algebra (field)
{: #field}
The definition in \eqref{1} gives that values of $\mu$ on the semialgebra $\mathcal{S}\_1$. To go from semialgebra to $\sigma$-algebra we use an intermediate step.  
A collection $\mathcal{A}$ of subsets of $\Omega$ is called an **algebra** (or **field**) if $A,B\in\mathcal{A}$ implies that $A^c\in\mathcal{A}$ and $A\cup B\in\mathcal{A}$, which also implies that $A\cap B\in\mathcal{A}$ (since $A\cap B=(A^c\cup B^c)^c$).

A $\sigma$-algebra is an algebra, but the converse is false.

**Example 4**  
Let $\Omega=\mathbb{Z}$, the integer space; and let $\mathcal{A}$ be the the collection of $A\subset\mathbb{Z}$ so that $A$ or $A^c$ is finite is an algebra.

*Proof*  



**Lemma 3**  
*If $\mathcal{S}$ is a semialgebra then $\bar{\mathcal{S}}=\Big\\{$ finite disjoint unions of sets in $\mathcal{S}\Big\\}$ is an algebra, called the* **algebra generated by $\mathbf{\mathcal{S}}$**.

*Proof*  
Suppose $A=+\_i S_i$ and $B=+\_j T_j$, where $+$ denotes disjoint union and we assume the index sets are finite. Then by definition of $\bar{\mathcal{S}}$, we have that $A,B\in\bar{\mathcal{S}}$. And moreover
\begin{equation}
A\cap B=+\_{i,j}S_i\cap T_j\in\bar{\mathcal{S}},
\end{equation}
which proves that $\bar{\mathcal{S}}$ is closed under intersection.  
Also, if $A=+\_i S_i$ then $A^c=\bigcap_i S_i^c$, the definition of $S$ says that $S_i^c\in\bar{\mathcal{S}}$. And since we just proved that $\bar{\mathcal{S}}$ is closed under intersection, we have that by induction
\begin{equation}
A^c=\bigcap_i S_i^c\in\bar{\mathcal{S}},
\end{equation}
which combined with the result of closed under intersection shows that $\bar{\mathcal{S}}$ is an algebra.

##### Measure on an algebra
{: #measure-on-an-algebra}
A **measure on an algebra** $\mathcal{A}$ is a set function $\mu$ with  
(i) $\mu(A)\geq\mu(\emptyset)=0$, for all $A\in\mathcal{A}$.  
(ii) If $A_i\in\mathcal{A}$ are disjoint and their union is in $\mathcal{A}$, then
\begin{equation}
\mu(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_i)=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(A_i)
\end{equation}
$\mu$ is said to be a **$\boldsymbol{\sigma}$-finite** if there is a sequence of sets $A_n\in\mathcal{A}$ so that $\mu(A_n)<\infty$ and $\bigcup_n A_n=\Omega$. Letting $A_1'=A_1$ and for $n\geq 2$,
\begin{equation}
A_n'=\bigcup_{m=1}^{n}A_m
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
A_n'=A_n\cap\left(\bigcap_{m=1}^{n-1}A_m^c\right)\in\mathcal{A}
\end{equation}

[^1]: The **complement** of a set $A\in\mathbb{R}^d$, denoted as $A^c$, is defined by
	\begin{equation}
	A^c=\\{x\in\mathbb{R}^d:\,x\notin A\\}
	\end{equation}

[^2]: The **open ball** in $\mathbb{R}^d$ centered at $x$ and of radius $r$ is defined by
	\begin{equation}
	B_r(x)=\\{y\in\mathbb{R}^d:\vert y-x\vert< r\\}
	\end{equation}
	A subset $E\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ is **open** if for every $x\in E$ there exists $r>0$ with $B_r(x)\subset E$.  
	And a set is **closed** if its complement is open.  
	Any (not necessarily countable) union of open sets is open, while in general, the intersection of only finitely many open sets is open.  
	A similar statement holds for the class of closed sets, if we interchange the roles of unions and intersections.

[^3]: **Difference** of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted as $B-A$, is defined as
	\begin{equation}
	B-A=B\cap A^c
	\end{equation}

[^4]: The **Borel $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$-algebra** in $\mathbb{R}^d$, denoted as $\mathcal{B}\_{\mathbb{R}^d}$, is the smallest $\sigma$-field that contains all the open sets. That means, if $\mathcal{S}$ is any $\sigma$-field containing all open sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, then necessarily $\mathcal{B}\_{\mathbb{R}^d}\subset\mathcal{S}$.  
	Elements of a Borel $\sigma$-algebra are called **Borel sets**, denoted as $\mathcal{R}^d$, which is the smallest $\sigma$-field containing the open sets.
