I"v<p>When talking about <em>measure</em>, you might associate it with the idea of <em>length</em>, the measurement of something in one dimension. And then probably, you will extend your idea into two dimensions with <em>area</em>, or even three dimensions with <em>volume</em>.
Despite of having different number of dimensions, all <em>length</em>, <em>area</em>, <em>volume</em> share the same properties.</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Non-negative</em>: In principle, length, area, and volume can be any positive value. But negative length has no meaning. Same thing happens with negative area and negative volume.</li>
  <li><em>Additivity</em>: To get from Hanoi to Singapore by air, you have to transit at Ho Chi Minh city (HCMC). If we cut that path into two non-overlapping pieces, say Hanoi - HCMC, and HCMC - Singapore, then the total length of the two pieces must be equal to the length of original path. If we divide a rectangular into non-overlapping pieces, the area of pieces combined must be the same as the original one. The same is true for volume as well.</li>
  <li><em>Empty Set</em>: An empty cup of water has volume zero.</li>
