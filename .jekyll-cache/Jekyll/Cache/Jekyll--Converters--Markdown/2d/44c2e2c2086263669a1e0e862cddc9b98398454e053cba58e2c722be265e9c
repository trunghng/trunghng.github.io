  <p>Recall that when using <a href="/artificial-intelligent/reinforcement-learning/2021/07/25/dp-in-mdp.html">dynamic programming (DP) method</a> in solving reinforcement learning problems, we required the availability of a model of the enviroment. Whereas with <a href="/artificial-intelligent/reinforcement-learning/2021/08/21/monte-carlo-in-rl.html">Monte Carlo methods</a> and <a href="/artificial-intelligent/reinforcement-learning/2022/01/31/td-learning.html">temporal-difference learning</a>, the model are unnecessary. Such methods with requirement of the model like the case of DP is called <strong>model-based</strong>, while methods without using</p>
