  <p>When talking about <strong>measure</strong>, you might associate it with the idea of <strong>length</strong>, the measurement of something in one dimension. And then probably, you will extend your idea into two dimensions with <strong>area</strong>, or even three dimensions with <strong>volume</strong>.</p>
