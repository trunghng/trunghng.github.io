I"<p>You may have known or heard vaguely about a computer program called AlphaGo - the AI has beaten Lee Sedol - the winner of 18 world Go titles. One of the techniques it used is called self-play against its other instances, with Reinforcement Learning.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-reinforcement-learning">What is Reinforcement Learning?</h3>
<p>Say, there is an unknown <em>environment</em> that weâ€™re trying to put an <em>agent</em> on. By interacting with the <em>agent</em> through taking <em>actions</em> that gives rise to <em>rewards</em> continually, the <em>agent</em> learns a <em>policy</em> that maximize the cumulative <em>rewards</em>.<br />
Reinforcement Learning, roughly speaking, is an area of Machine Learning that describes methods aimed to learn a good strategy for the <em>agent</em> from experimental trials and relative simple feedback received. With the optimal <em>policy</em>, the agent is capable to actively adapt to the environment to maximize future rewards.
