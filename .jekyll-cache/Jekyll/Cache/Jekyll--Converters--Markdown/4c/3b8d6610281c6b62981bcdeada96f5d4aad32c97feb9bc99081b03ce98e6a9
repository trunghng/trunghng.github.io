<p>When talking about <em>measure</em>, you might associate it with the idea of <em>length</em>, the measurement of something in one dimension. And then probably, you will extend your idea into two dimensions with <em>area</em>, or even three dimensions with <em>volume</em>.
Despite of having different number of dimensions, all <em>length</em>, <em>area</em>, <em>volume</em> share the same properties:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Non-negative</em>: In principle, length, area, and volume can be any positive value. But negative length has no meaning. Same thing happens with negative area and negative volume.</li>
  <li><em>Additivity</em>: To get from Hanoi to Singapore by air, you have to transit at Ho Chi Minh city (HCMC). If we cut that path into two non-overlapping pieces, say Hanoi - HCMC, and HCMC - Singapore, then the total length of the two pieces must be equal to the length of original path. If we divide a rectangular into non-overlapping pieces, the area of pieces combined must be the same as the original one. The same is true for volume as well.</li>
  <li><em>Empty Set</em>: An empty cup of water has volume zero.</li>
  <li><em>Other Null Sets</em>: The length of a point is 0. The area of a line, or a curve is 0. The volumn of a plane or a surface is 0.</li>
  <li><em>Translation Invariance</em>: Length, area and volume are unchanged (<em>invariant</em>) under shifts (<em>translation</em>) in space.</li>
  <li><em>Hyper-rectangles</em>: An interval of form $[a, b]\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ has length $b-a$. The area of a rectangle $[a_1,b_1]\times[a_2,b_2]$ is $(b_1-a_1)(b_2-a_2)$. And the volume of a rectangular $[a_1,b_1]\times[a_2,b_2]\times[a_3,b_3]$ is $(b_1-a_1)(b_2-a_2)(b_3-a_3)$.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="lebesgue-measure">Lebesgue measure</h3>
<p>Is an extension of the classical notion of length in $\mathbb{R}$, area in $\mathbb{R}^2$ to any $\mathbb{R}^k$ using k-dimensional hyper-rectangles.</p>

<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>Given an open set $S=\sum_k(a_k,b_k)$ cointaining disjoint invervals, the <strong>Lebesgue measure</strong> is defined by:
\begin{equation}
\mu_L(S)=\sum_{k}(b_k-a_k)
\end{equation}
Given a closed set $S’=[a,b]-\sum_k(a_k,b_k)$,
\begin{equation}
\mu_L(S’)=(b-a)-\sum_k(b_k-a_k)
\end{equation}</p>

<h3 id="measures">Measures</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br />
Let $\mathcal{X}$ be any set. A <em>measure</em> on $\mathcal{X}$ í a function $\mu$ that maps the set of subsets on $\mathcal{X}$ to $[0,\infty]$ ($\mu:2^\mathcal{X}\rightarrow[0,\infty]$) that satisfies:</p>
