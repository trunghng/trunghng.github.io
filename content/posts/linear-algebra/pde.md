## Partial diffential equations
A partial differential equation (PDE) is an identity that relates the independent variables, $x,y,\ldots$, the dependent variable $u$, i.e., $u(x,y,\ldots)$, and the partial derivative of $u$. Specifically, denoting the order of an equation is the highest derivate that appears, here are the most general PDE in two independent variables of first and second order
\begin{equation}
F(x,y,u(x,y),u_x(x,y),u_y(x,y))=F(x,y,u_x,u_y)=0
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
F(x,y,u,u_x,u_y,u_{xx},u_{xy},u_{yy})=0,
\end{equation}
where $u_x=\partial u/\partial x,u_{xy}=\partial^2 u/\partial x\partial y$.
